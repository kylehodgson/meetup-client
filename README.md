meetup-client
=============

Scala based meetup.com API client.

The goal of this project is to develop an app that can connect to Meetup.com over its API, download
events from a shortlist of pre-configured groups, and create an email about each one. The purpose
is to augment Meetup.com's internal email notification feature, as well as providing capability to
notify non-Meetup.com members of upcoming events that they may be interested in. 

As an interested community member,
I would like to receive an email telling me about events for the next two weeks for
groups that I am interested in,
So that I can regsiter for these events and possibly attend.

As an interested community member and Gmail Calendar user,
I would like to see the events for the groups I'm interested in for the next two weeks
on my Gmail Calendar
So that I can decide what events I might like to go to and plan my week.
